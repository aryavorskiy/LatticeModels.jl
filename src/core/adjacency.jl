"""
    AdjacencyMatrix{LT} where {LT<:Lattice}

Represents the bonds on some lattice.

`AdjacencyMatrix`s can be combined with the `|` operator and negated with the `!` operator.
Also you can create a `AdjacencyMatrix` which connects sites that were connected by `â‰¤n` bonds of the previous `AdjacencyMatrix`
by taking its power: `bs2 = bs1 ^ n`.
